# Geospatial_System_Assignment_1.0

A software development senior year assignment to create a geospatial recommender system using life-logging via uploads and social media posts. 
It uses C#.NET, WinForms, a Google Maps API as the program foundation, as well as Facebook and Twitter APIs to track social media posts.
The People Dictionary section is hard-coded and unable to save new entries, and uses a static design. However, everything else should upload dynamically. 

The Google Maps API key was removed for security reasons. Should this project be reused, a new Maps key will need to be generated.
